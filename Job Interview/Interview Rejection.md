# Before Interview Ends
Try to be better at next interview, better at each time, ask questions what went wrong.

At last 5-10 minutes of the interview, ask:
- Is there any places in the interview I could've done better?


# After Rejection Letter
Ask again:
- Is there anything specific that you call out for me because I really would like to learn 
- Could you please give me 2-3 things I could work on to get the next job
