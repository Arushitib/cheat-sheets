# ðŸ“¥ Import Modules in Python

- Import modules or packages with the import keyword
	- import `<package_name>`
- Assign your own name with the as keyword
	- import `<package_name>` as `<new_name>`
- Import specific methods, classes, or packages
	- from `<package_name>` import `<method/class>`
- Gets rid of dot notation: 
	- `package_name.method()` becomes `method()`
