# Intro to Ruby
- Ruby similar to **Python**
- Ruby **does not use a compiler**
	- So it checks **Types** at `runtime/execution`
- Ruby uses `dynamic type-checking` 
	- Meaning that data type is determined at `runtime`
- In Ruby, **everything is a class**, except for `nil`
	- However, `nil` is an object of `NilClass`

# Dynamic Type vs Static Type
- Dynamic Type-checking Languages: Python, Ruby, JavaScript, PHP, Perl, Objective-C
	- Types are checked at `run-time`
- Static Type-checking Languages: C, Java, Rust, TypeScript, Swift, Kotlin
	- Types are checked at `compile time`

# Explicit Typing vs Implicit Typing
- Ruby uses `latent` or `implicit typing` where you don't have to declare the type of a variable.
	- `Latent` is not the same as `dynamic typing`
- In contrast `manifest` or `explicit typing` where explicitly declare the type of any variable we create. Suchas as: C, TypeScript
	- `Manifest` is not the same as `static typing`
