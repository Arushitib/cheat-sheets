# Object Type
- In JavaScript, functions are objects
- There are several constructor functions (e.g., Object, Array, Function, Boolean) – Execute typeof Array on the console 
- Object - constructor function (an object itself) that supports object creation. If you enter type Object in the console you will get ‘function’; if you enter Object you will see: – ƒ Object() { [native code] } 
- As an object, Object (even though it is a function) can have properties
- You can see several properties of Object by typing (in the console) Object followed by a period and waiting
