# `When` keyword
Patterns can also incorporate conditions or¬†_guards_¬†that impose restrictions on the match; these guards are introduced by the keyword¬†when¬†with the syntax:¬†_pattern_¬†when¬†_expr1_¬†->¬†_expr2_.¬†_expr1_¬†is a Boolean expression (it can reference variables bound by the pattern) and the entire clause matches only if the guard is¬†true. Here's a rewrite of the¬†mem¬†function using a guard:

```ocaml
let rec mem x list =
	match list with 
	| [] -> false
	| h::_ when h = x -> true
    | _::t -> mem x t
```


# `Ref` keyword

## How to count++ inside a statement

In the given OCaml code, the `count` variable is declared with an incorrect syntax. To declare and initialize a variable in OCaml, you can use the `let` keyword followed by the variable name, the `=` sign, and the initial value. Therefore, the correct syntax to declare and initialize `count` would be:

```ocaml
let count = ref 0 in
```

Note that we are using a reference type here instead of a regular integer type. This is because we want to modify the value of `count` inside the `fold` function.

To increment `count` inside the `fold` function, we can use the `:=` operator, which is the assignment operator for reference types. Therefore, the modified code would be:

```ocaml
let same_length lst1 lst2 =   
	let len1 = length lst1 in   
	let len2 = length lst2 in   
	let count = ref 0 in   
	if len1 > len2 then      
		fold (fun acc e -> 
				if !count < len2 then 
					(count := !count + 1; e::acc) 
				else 
					acc
			) 
			[] 
			(lst1)   
	else     
		lst1
```

`!count` to dereference the reference type and get the actual integer value. 
`count := !count + 1` statement inside the lambda function to increment `count` for each element that is added to the new list.
