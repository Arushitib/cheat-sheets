Consider the list A with the pivot value p = 3. index 0 1 2 3 4 A The leftmost element greater than p = 3 is A[0] = 5. The first subsequent element less than or equal to p = 3 is A[1] = 2 so we swap those two: index 0 1 2 3 4 A The leftmost element greater than p = 3 is A[1] = 5. The first subsequent element less than or equal to p = 3 is A[3] = 1 so we swap those two: index 0 1 2 3 4 A The leftmost element greater than p = 3 is A[2] = 4.

There are no subsequent elements less than or equal to p = 3. Thus we are done. Observe that the pivot values is such that all elements to the left are less than or equal to it and all elements to the right are greater than it.","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"eng","hash":"","size":0}
