Suppose our list contains n integers between 0 and n—1 inclusive and we slyly choose b = n so that we only need d = 1 of them. If we use RadixSort+CountingSort then the underlying CountingSort has k = b = n and therefore is ©(n+n) and so the resulting RadixSort will be ©(1(n+n)) = ©(n). In this case of course we're really not doing RadixSort at all, we’re just doing a single iteration of CountingSort. ]","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"eng","hash":"","size":0}
