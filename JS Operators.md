# Intro to Operators

# Chaining (`?`) Operator

# Revising &&, || / Coalescing Operator

- **logical (`&&`)** - if the first operand evaluates to false, the first operand is returned; otherwise, the second operand is returned – Whatever makes it false is the value returned

- **Logical (`||`)** - if the first operand evaluates to true, the first operand is returned; otherwise, the second operand is returned – Whatever makes it true is the value returned

- **nullish coalescing operator (`??`)** - returns the value of the second operand if the left operator is null or undefined.
